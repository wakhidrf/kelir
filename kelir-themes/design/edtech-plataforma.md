## Overview

Edtech landing online courses, gamification, progress badges, vibrant colors, students, learning path, challenges, modern UI. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Early edtech interfaces were glorified PDF viewers. Coursera launched in 2012 with a layout that basically said "here's a video, good luck" — and honestly, it worked for a while. The content carried the experience. Then Duolingo showed up and rewrote the rules. Streaks, XP bars, heart systems. Suddenly learning platforms had to feel like games or nobody would come back.

Khan Academy took a quieter path — mastery-based progression, skill trees, that satisfying blue-to-green color shift when you leveled up a concept. No confetti explosions, just clear visual feedback that you were getting somewhere. The progress bar became the hero component of an entire industry.

Here's the tension nobody resolved cleanly: engagement mechanics and actual learning outcomes don't always align. Duolingo's streak keeps you opening the app daily, but does it make you fluent? The best edtech UI today walks this line carefully — gamification that serves comprehension, not just retention metrics. Progress visualization that reflects real mastery, not just time spent clicking.
