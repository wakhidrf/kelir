## Overview

Glassmorphism landing page, futuristic glass ui, transparent panels, blur effects, glowing edges, dark background, 3d interface. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Glassmorphism didn't emerge from nowhere. It's the logical endpoint of a decades-long oscillation between flat and dimensional UI. Apple's iOS 7 introduced translucent panels in 2013 — a quiet rebellion against skeuomorphism that planted the seed. But the futuristic variant? That owes more to science fiction than to Cupertino. Think Minority Report interfaces, holographic HUDs in Iron Man, the layered transparency of Blade Runner 2049's data screens. Designers watched those films and thought: what if software actually felt like that?

The technical unlock came around 2020 when backdrop-filter finally shipped across browsers without catastrophic performance hits. Suddenly you could layer frosted panels over dynamic backgrounds without faking it with static blurs. The aesthetic exploded on Dribbble, got a name, got overused, got dismissed — and then matured.

What survived the hype cycle is the futuristic strain. Not the soft pastel cards of 2021, but something harder-edged. Panels with subtle luminous borders, dark substrates, chromatic refractions at the edges. It stopped trying to look like frosted glass and started looking like engineered light. That's where it lives now — at the intersection of material honesty and speculative fiction.

## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Dark background
- Do Frosted glass containers (blur)
- Do Glowing borders/edges
- Do Floating elements with depth
- Do Clean sans-serif typography
