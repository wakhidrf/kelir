## Overview

Playful, toy-like interface with soft 3D, chunky elements, bubbly aesthetic, rounded edges (16-24px), thick borders (3-4px), double shadows (inner + outer), pastel colors, smooth animations. Ideal for apps infantis, creative tools, education, jogos interativos. AI-ready template. Claymorphism emerged around 2021 as designers got bored with flat UI and started pulling visual language from 3D illustration tools. The Clay.io aesthetic, combined with the explosion of Blender and Cinema4D artists creating chunky, inflated characters for tech brands, gave UI designers permission to make interfaces feel tactile again. People were rendering soft, squishy objects and thinking: why can't buttons feel like this?

It's worth distinguishing this from neumorphism, which tried (and mostly failed) to simulate realistic depth through subtle light and shadow on monochrome surfaces. Claymorphism doesn't pretend to be realistic. It's deliberately toy-like, exaggerated, cartoonish. The shadows are colored. The shapes are puffy. Nothing here is trying to fool your eye into thinking it's a real object on your desk.

By 2026, claymorphism has settled into a comfortable niche. You see it in educational platforms, creative tools, and anywhere the brand voice skews young or playful. It never took over enterprise UI (thankfully), but it proved that depth and whimsy have a place in digital product design when the context is right.

## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap 80%)
- No 3-column equal feature layouts — zig-zag or asymmetric
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Border-radius 16-24px
- Do Thick borders 3-4px
- Do Double shadows (inner+outer)
